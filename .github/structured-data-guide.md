# Structured Data Implementation Guide

## What is Structured Data?

Structured data is code that you add to your website to help search engines understand your content better. It uses a standardized vocabulary (Schema.org) to describe things like businesses, products, services, articles, etc.

## Why Use Structured Data?

1. **Rich Snippets** - Enhanced search results with ratings, prices, images
2. **Better Understanding** - Search engines understand your content context
3. **Voice Search** - Better compatibility with Alexa, Google Assistant
4. **Knowledge Panels** - Your business info in Google's knowledge panel
5. **SEO Benefits** - Improved click-through rates and visibility

## Search Results Enhancement Example

## How to Use in Your Pages

```astro
---
// Any page (e.g., src/pages/about.astro)
import Layout from '../layouts/Layout.astro';

// Define your structured data
const aboutSchema = {
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "AboutPage",
  "name": "About Enserve Engineering",
  // ... your schema data
};
---

<Layout
  title="About Enserve Engineering | Industrial Solutions"

  canonicalURL={new URL('/about', Astro.site)}
  structuredData={aboutSchema}
>
  <!-- Your page content -->
</Layout>
```

## Layout Implementation

Your `Layout.astro` should include this in the `<head>`:

```astro
<!-- Structured Data Injection -->
{structuredData && (
  <script type="application/ld+json" set:html={JSON.stringify(structuredData)} />
)}
```
